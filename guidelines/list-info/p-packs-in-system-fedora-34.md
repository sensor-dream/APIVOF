             : determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
             : slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
             : 
             : This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
             : eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than

             : that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different

             : 
             : Collections can be seen as more specialized arrays for which certain contracts
             : are guaranteed.
             : 
             : Supported Collections:
             : * Sequences
             : ** Keys: numerical, consequentially increasing, no gaps
             : ** Values: anything, duplicates allowed

Descript     : phpDocumentor is an application that is capable of analyzing your PHP source

             : 
             : Features: phpDocumentor supports the following:
             : * PHP 5.3 compatible, full support for Namespaces, Closures and more is provided
             : * Shows any tag, some tags add additional functionality to phpDocumentor

             : * Processing speed, Zend Framework experienced a significant reduction in
             :   processing time compared to phpDocumentor 1
             : * Low memory usage, peak memory usage for small projects is less than 20MB,
             :   medium projects 40MB and large frameworks 100MB
             : * Incremental parsing, if you kept the Structure file from a previous run you
             :   get an additional performance boost of up to 80% on top of the mentioned
             :   processing speed above
             : * Easy template building, if you want to make a branding you only have to call
             :   1 task and edit 3 files
             : * Command-line compatibility with phpDocumentor 1, phpDocumentor 2 is an
             :   application in its own right but the basic phpDocumentor 1 arguments,
             :   such as --directory, --file and --target, have been adopted
             : * Two-step process, phpDocumentor first generates a cache with your application
             :   structure before creating the output. If you'd like you can use that to power
             :   your own tools or formatters!

Short desc   : Library to provide abstract access to various archives
URL          : http://www.icculus.org/physfs/
License      : zlib
Descript     : PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. It is
             : intended for use in video games, and the design was somewhat inspired by Quake
             : 3's file subsystem. The programmer defines a "write directory" on the physical
             : filesystem. No file writing done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that
             : write directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting language
             : cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its I/O, which
             : means that untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links can be
             : disabled as well, for added safety. For file reading, the programmer lists
             : directories and archives that form a "search path". Once the search path is
             : defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. This makes
             : for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on
             : the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override a
             : previous archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you
             : platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the user's
             : home directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, etc.
