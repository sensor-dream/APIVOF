Short desc   : A library for instantiating Java objects
URL          : http://objenesis.org/
License      : ASL 2.0
Descript     : Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
             : a new object of a particular class.
             : Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
             : however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
             : are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
             : the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
             : and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
             : in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
             : Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
             : on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
             : the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
             : when this is useful:
             : * Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
             :   and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
             : * Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
             :   needing to worry about the super() constructor.
             : * Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
             :   non-standard ways.

             :   parts in the file.
