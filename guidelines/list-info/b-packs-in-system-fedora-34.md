License      : LGPLv2+
Descript     : bolt is a system daemon to manage Thunderbolt devices via a D-BUS
             : API. Thunderbolt 3 introduced different security modes that require
             : devices to be authorized before they can be used. The D-Bus API can be
             : used to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the
             : local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
             : devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
             : removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
             : authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
             : boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
             : mentioned tasks.
