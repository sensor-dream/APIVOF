Descript     : Judy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology that
             : implements a sparse dynamic array. Judy arrays are declared simply with a null
             : pointer. A Judy array consumes memory only when it is populated, yet can grow
             : to take advantage of all available memory if desired. Judy's key benefits are
             : scalability, high performance, and memory efficiency. A Judy array is
             : extensible and can scale up to a very large number of elements, bounded only by
             : machine memory. Since Judy is designed as an unbounded array, the size of a
             : Judy array is not pre-allocated but grows and shrinks dynamically with the
             : array population.
