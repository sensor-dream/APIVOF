Descript     : Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
             : designer Łukasz Dziedzic ("Lato" means "Summer" in Polish). In December 2010 the

             : tyPoland, with support from Google.
             : 
             : When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
             : conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
             : "transparent" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
             : used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
             : uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
             : time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
             : was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.
             : 
             : The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
             : strong structure provides stability and seriousness. "Male and female, serious
             : but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer," says Łukasz.
             : 
             : Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
             : beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
             : Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
