Описание     : An optimized implementation of the JPEG-LS standard for loss less and
             : near loss less image compression. JPEG-LS is a low-complexity standard that
             : matches JPEG 2000 compression ratios. In terms of speed, CharLS outperforms
             : open source and commercial JPEG LS implementations.
             : 
             : JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is a standard derived from the Hewlett Packard
             : LOCO algorithm. JPEG LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high
             : compression ratios, similar to JPEG 2000. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old
             : loss less JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques
             : result in vastly different performance characteristics.
